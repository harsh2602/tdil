### Till Date I Learned

Inspired by this `Addy Osmani's` tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better.<br><br>Sometimes the gaps in your knowledge only become clear when you try explaining things to others. It&#39;s OK if no one reads what you write. You get a lot out of just doing it for *you*.</p>&mdash; Addy Osmani (@addyosmani) <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1260779133769924608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here I write byte-sized articles about what I have learned. I was initially thinking of putting the repo as `Today I Learned` but soon figured out it's hard to post a completed article everyday. 

My goal is to get better at Front-end and programming as a whole.
